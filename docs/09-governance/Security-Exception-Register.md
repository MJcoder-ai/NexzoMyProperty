# Security Exception Register

Use this register to document approved deviations from security policy. Each entry must include expiry date and mitigating controls.

| ID | Date Raised | Owner | Description | Risk | Mitigations | Expiry | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SER-2025-001 | TBD |  |  |  |  |  | Open |

Process:
1. Submit exception request via security Jira template.
2. Security review assesses risk, proposes mitigations, sets expiry.
3. Approval required from CISO + relevant VP/Director.
4. Track remediation progress; update status when closed.

Review register monthly; expired exceptions must be remediated or renewed with justification.
