# Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

> **Scope**: Canonical requirements for building AI‑agentic, multi‑tenant, multi‑user, multi‑domain platforms (engineering design, property management, trading, e‑commerce, project management, customer support, business assistant).  
> **Contract‑First**: Requirements reference the ODL‑SD document contract, JSON‑Patch mutation model, typed Tool Registry, and API/versioning policies. See cross‑references in the front‑matter.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This TRD translates the Product (PRD) and System Architecture into testable **functional** and **non‑functional** requirements. It institutionalizes core patterns for agentic systems—**Ground‑before‑Generate**, **JSON‑Patch writes**, **typed tools**, **observability**, **RBAC/phase gates**, and **governed evolution** (APIs, models, prompts).

**Success Criteria (platform‑wide):**

- Grounded‑answer rate ≥ **95%**; hallucination ≤ **5%** (tool‑verified).  
- p95 grounded response latency ≤ **2 s**; API availability ≥ **99.95%**.  
- Cost control: policy‑routed model use within **PSU budgets**; blue/green rollback < **5 min**.  
- Full traceability: every write is a JSON‑Patch with audit, evidence, and inverse‑patch.  

---

## 2. Scope & Out‑of‑Scope

### 2.1 In Scope
- Multi‑tenant user/org management; role‑based access and **phase gates**.
- ODL‑SD (v4.1) design/operations document as **single source of truth**.
- Agent Orchestrator (planner/router, critic/verifier, scheduler), memory & retrieval, Tool Registry, evaluations, cost policies.
- API gateway, versioning/deprecation, webhooks, events, and client SDKs.
- Procurement/marketplace, logistics & inventory, warranty/RMA (optional per domain).
- Observability (metrics, traces, logs), SLO/SLA, and incident management.
- Security & privacy baselines, STRIDE threat mitigations, DPIA alignment.

### 2.2 Out of Scope
- Deep domain‑specific algorithms beyond documented tool contracts (handled in domain packages).  
- Third‑party billing/ERP specifics (integrated via connectors).

---

## 3. Definitions & Abbreviations
- **ODL‑SD** — OriginFlow Design Language – System Document (JSON contract).  
- **JSON‑Patch** — RFC 6902 atomic mutation list for the ODL‑SD document.  
- **Tool Registry** — Typed, versioned catalog of callable tools (inputs/outputs, side‑effects, RBAC scope).  
- **CAG** — Cache‑Ahead‑of‑Generate store for prompts/embeddings/tool results/sims.  
- **PSU** — Premium Simulation Unit (heavy compute budget unit).  
- **RBAC** — Role‑Based Access Control with rights codes (R/W/P/A/X/S).

---

## 4. Stakeholders & Roles
- **Product** (PRD), **Architecture**, **Security**, **Data**, **AI/ML**, **Platform/DevOps**, **Frontend**, **Compliance/Legal**, **Support/CS**, **Tenants/Customers**, and **Vendors/Suppliers** (limited scopes).

---

## 5. Assumptions & Dependencies
- Cloud‑first deployment (GCP‑first reference), Postgres (multi‑tenant with RLS), Redis for sessions/CAG/rate‑limits, OpenTelemetry stack for traces/metrics/logs.  
- Contract‑first artifacts exist and are versioned: OpenAPI, model cards, prompt library, tool specs, schemas.  
- DPIA and Threat Model reviewed each release; governance gates enforced in CI/CD.

---

## 6. Architectural Constraints
- **Single Source of Truth**: All design/ops state must reside in an ODL‑SD document; no shadow schemas.  
- **Mutation Contract**: All writes to ODL‑SD occur via validated JSON‑Patch; server applies atomically and can emit an inverse patch.  
- **Versioning**: APIs, models, prompts, tools follow SemVer and deprecation timelines; breaking changes require migrations and notices.  
- **RBAC & Phase Gates**: Rights and write‑locks change by lifecycle phase; approvals required for gated sections.  
- **Observability by Design**: Every request/response and tool call is traced with cost and latency.  

---

## 7. Functional Requirements (FR)

> **Notation**: `FR-<domain>-<seq>`; each FR has minimum **Acceptance Criteria (AC)** and **Verification** methods.

### 7.1 Tenancy & Identity
- **FR-TEN-001** — The system SHALL support **org‑scoped multi‑tenancy** with hierarchical nodes (portfolio → site → plant …) and **row‑level security**.  
  **AC**: Users only access resources within assigned org/nodes; inheritance works downward; tests cover guest/client/supplier.  
  **Verification**: RLS tests; penetration tests; role matrix tests.

- **FR-TEN-002** — Implement **RBAC** with rights **R/W/P/A/X/S**, approver matrices, **phase gates**, and MFA for sensitive roles.

  **Verification**: Schema validation tests; fault injection; audit review.

### 7.4 APIs, Clients & Webhooks
- **FR-API-001** — REST APIs MUST be OpenAPI‑described, with **operationIds**, examples, and **Spectral** rules enforced in CI; **deprecation headers** when applicable.  
  **AC**: Spec passes governance checks; examples for 100% of responses; version headers set.  
  **Verification**: Spectral CI; contract tests; “can‑i‑deploy” checks.

  **AC**: Retries with exponential backoff; signature verification; idempotency keys.  
  **Verification**: Webhook integration tests; replay tests.

### 7.5 UI/UX Surfaces

  **AC**: Timeline view of events; evidence attachments; stock updates on delivery.  
  **Verification**: e2e procurement sandbox; EPCIS ingest tests.

- **FR-PROC-002** — Component lifecycle states (draft → parsed → dedupe_pending → compliance_pending → approved → …) and warranty/RMA flows.  
  **AC**: State machine complete; transitions validated; audit captured.  
  **Verification**: State transition tests; warranty/RMA e2e.

### 7.7 Commerce & Monetisation (optional per domain)
- **FR-COM-001** — Plans (Free/Pro/Enterprise), PSU budgets, transparent fees (components, service handovers), escrow milestones with governance triggers.  
  **AC**: Accurate fee calculation; PSU metering/alerts; escrow release on milestone events.  
  **Verification**: Pricing simulations; PSU budget tests; escrow webhook tests.

### 7.8 Observability, Audit & Governance
